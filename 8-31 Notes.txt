Notes ---- Aug 31st

Regression:
Multiple regression:

x,y one dependant and one independant
x & y -- bivariant relationship
x, y & z -- multivariant relationship
we have y as in dependant and x,z as an independant variable. testing to see if those two independant variables have an impact on y.
combined effects of those. 
capable of disentangling those. 
logic jump off point is linear regression (bivariant analysis)

y = 1:5
yeilds 1 2 3 4 5 

min, max, mean, sd

Measures of Central Tendancy:
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode
 
Levels of Measurement of Data:
  - Nominal: Data you can't rank - yes or no (ex: gender)
  - Ordinal: there is an order to this (ex: salaries, low/middle/high income)
  - Interval/Ratio: pure numbers, they have an absolute position/value, you can compare it to other values. There is a true zero value to it. You can do mathematical operations on it. 

Measures of Variation:
  - Range: doesn't tell you anything about the distribution of the data within the range
  - Standard Deviation: the amount of variation we have in our data
        Normal distribution curve
        -3s, -2s, -1s, s, +1s, +2s, +3s on the bell curve
        +/-2s = within 2 standard deviations of the mean
        z scores: convert your raw score to a z score 
        standard deviation is part of regression -- how far is each data elemebt from our mean?
        IQV - put in quartiles. Look at Q2 and Q3 because the other two are considered outliers.
        sample data... statistically significant: it cannot be explained, something else is happening. The difference is not due to random chance. 

Bivariate Analysis: (?)
    Nominal 
    Ordinal 
    Interval/Ration 
    
Relationships 
    (1) Is there a relationship?
    (2) How strong is the relationship?
    (3) Pattern or Direction
    
dat = read("star.csv", header = TRUE)
mean(dat$tmathssk) <-- find the mean of tmathssk within dat data set 
table(dat$sex)

Categorical variables: nominal and ordinal variables
